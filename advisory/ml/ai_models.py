    In a real application:
    1. **Data Collection:**
       - `weather_data` would be fetched from IMD APIs based on location and current/historical dates.
       - `soil_type` and other soil health parameters would be retrieved from Govt. Soil Health Card data.
       - Historical crop data (yields, input costs) would be used for training.

    2. **Model Loading & Prediction:**
       - A pre-trained scikit-learn or XGBoost model would be loaded.
       - Features (e.g., crop_type, soil_type, temperature, rainfall, humidity) would be extracted/engineered.
       - The model would predict the yield.

    3. **Recommendation Generation:**
       - Based on the predicted yield and other factors, a personalized recommendation is generated.
