   ```
   Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows)
   Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
   ```

2. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   ```
   Ctrl + Shift + Delete
   ```

3. **Check Console (F12):**
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Should see: "🎉 All services initialized!"

4. **Run Verification:**
   ```powershell
   python verify_service_cards_fix.py
   ```

### Server Won't Start?

If you see Celery errors, the import has been temporarily disabled in `core/__init__.py`. This doesn't affect the service cards functionality.
