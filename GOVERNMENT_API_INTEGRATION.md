  "area": "1.0 hectares",
  "nutrient_requirements": {
    "nitrogen": {
      "base_amount": 120,
      "adjusted_amount": 120.0,
      "unit": "kg/hectare",
      "timing": "Split application"
    },
    "phosphorus": {
      "base_amount": 60,
      "adjusted_amount": 66.0,
      "unit": "kg/hectare",
      "timing": "Basal application"
    }
  },
  "recommended_fertilizers": [
    "Urea (46% N)",
    "DAP (18% N, 46% P2O5)",
    "MOP (60% K2O)",
    "Zinc Sulfate",
    "Farmyard Manure"
  ],
  "cost_estimation": {
    "total_cost": 4500.0,
    "currency": "INR"
  },
  "source": "ICAR & Government Agricultural Data"
}
```

## Enhanced Chatbot Capabilities

### New Query Types Supported
1. **Fertilizer Recommendations**:
   - "fertilizer recommendation for wheat in loamy soil"
   - "गेहूं के लिए दोमट मिट्टी में उर्वरक सिफारिश"

2. **Crop Substitution**:
   - "crop alternatives for sandy soil"
   - "रेतली मिट्टी के लिए फसल विकल्प"

3. **Government Data Queries**:
   - "current market prices from Agmarknet"
   - "weather forecast from IMD"

## Implementation Details

### Fallback Mechanism
All government API integrations include robust fallback mechanisms:
1. **Primary**: Attempt to fetch data from government APIs
2. **Secondary**: Use enhanced mock data if APIs are unavailable
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with informative error messages

### Data Sources Priority
1. **Real-time Government Data** (when available)
2. **Enhanced Mock Data** (based on government data patterns)
3. **Error Messages** (with guidance for users)
