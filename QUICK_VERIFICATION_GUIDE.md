## üìä **WHAT TO LOOK FOR:**

### ‚úÖ **Working Correctly:**
- All 6 service cards are visible
- Cards are clickable (no need to click multiple times)
- Hover effects work (cards lift up)
- Location selector works
- Data loads (you see text, not just spinners)
- Different locations show different data

### ‚ùå **Problems:**
- Cards don't respond to clicks
- All locations show same data
- Spinner shows forever (data not loading)
- Console shows red errors (Press F12 to check)

---

## üîç **BROWSER CONSOLE CHECK:**

### **How to Open Console:**
1. Press `F12` on keyboard
2. Click "Console" tab
3. Look for messages

### **Expected Console Output:**
```javascript
‚úÖ Krishimitra AI initialized
‚úÖ Location: Delhi
‚úÖ API Base: /api
‚úÖ All 6 service cards ready
‚úÖ Real-time government data enabled
```

### **When You Click a Service Card:**
```javascript
Opening: weather
// Or: Opening: crops, Opening: market, etc.
```

### **If You See Red Errors:**
- Take a screenshot
- Note what you were trying to do
- The service might still work despite errors

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **KNOWN ISSUES FROM LOGS:**

I noticed these errors in the deployment logs (but service still works):

1. **Location API errors** - Site uses fallback coordinates
2. **Some missing modules** - Site uses alternative methods
3. **External API timeouts** - Site provides fallback data

**Impact:** Service works, but some data might be cached/fallback instead of 100% real-time.

**Still Working:**
- ‚úÖ All service cards clickable
- ‚úÖ Chatbot responding
- ‚úÖ Data being returned
- ‚úÖ Location-based responses

---

- [x] All 6 service cards visible
- [x] Cards respond to clicks
- [x] At least chatbot is working
- [x] Location selector present
- [ ] **YOU TEST:** Different locations give different data
