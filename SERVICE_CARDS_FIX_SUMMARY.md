# 🔧 Service Cards Clickability Fix - COMPLETED

**Date:** January 14, 2025  
**Issue:** Service cards were not clickable in the frontend UI  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED & VERIFIED**

---

## 🎯 Problem Identified

The service cards in the frontend were not responding to clicks due to:
1. **CSS Issues**: Child elements were blocking click events
2. **JavaScript Conflicts**: Duplicate DOMContentLoaded handlers causing conflicts

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. CSS Pointer Events Fix (6 Rules Modified)

Added `pointer-events: none` to all child elements that were blocking clicks:

```css
✅ .service-card::before { pointer-events: none; z-index: 1; }
✅ .service-status { pointer-events: none; z-index: 2; }
✅ .service-icon { pointer-events: none; }
✅ .service-title { pointer-events: none; }
✅ .service-description { pointer-events: none; }
✅ .service-button::before { pointer-events: none; }
```

### 2. JavaScript Event Handler Consolidation

**Before:** Two separate `DOMContentLoaded` handlers causing conflicts  
**After:** Single merged handler with all initialization code

**Merged Handler Includes:**
- ✅ Session ID initialization
- ✅ Location setup
- ✅ Service card click event listeners (all 6 cards)
- ✅ Test button handler
- ✅ Scheme button handlers
- ✅ Initial data loading
